# Heedless Backbones
![Alt text](assets/plot_view.png?raw=true "Plot View")
A simple web application for comparing computer vision backbones performance on classification and downstream tasks.

## The Problem
Paperswithcode's basic data models and user interface aren't useful either for researchers or industry users interested in comparing the performance of different computer vision backbones for different tasks.

## WIP
- Model Family Pages
- Dataset Pages (might just link to website)
- Host the Website
- Add Semantic Segmentation as a downstream task
- Add More Backbones


## Completed
- Dynamic Plotting
-- Result vs num params or GFLOPS
-- Result vs Result (Different Dataset or Metric)
-- Result vs Throughput
-- Resolution and Pretrain Dataset Filters 
- Accompanying Tables
- Models Added:
-- ConvNeXt
-- TransNeXt

## Updates
9-2-2024: added resolution and pretraining dataset filters
9-1-2024: added table on plot page
