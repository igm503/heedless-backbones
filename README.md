# Heedless Backbones
![Alt text](assets/plot_view.png?raw=true "Plot View")
A simple web application for comparing computer vision backbones performance on classification and downstream tasks.

## The Problem
Paperswithcode's basic data models and user interface aren't useful either for researchers or industry users interested in comparing the performance of different computer vision backbones for different tasks.


## WIP
- Model Family Pages
- Dataset Pages
- Resolution Filters for Plots
- Add More Backbones
- Host the Website
- Add Semantic Segmentation as a downstream task


## Completed
- Dynamic Plotting
- Accompanying Tables
- Models Added:
-- ConvNeXt
-- TransNeXt
