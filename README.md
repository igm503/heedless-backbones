# [Coming Soon]

# Heedless Backbones
![Alt text](assets/plot_view.png?raw=true "Plot View")
A simple web application for comparing computer vision backbones performance on classification and downstream tasks.

## The Problem
Paperswithcode's basic data models and user interface aren't useful either for researchers or industry users interested in comparing the performance of different computer vision backbones for different tasks.

## TODO
- Dataset Pages
- Add Family List Page
- Host the Website
- Add Semantic Segmentation as a downstream task
- Add More Backbones


## Completed
- Dynamic Plotting
  - Result vs num params or GFLOPS
  - Result vs Result (Different Dataset or Metric)
  - Result vs Throughput
  - Resolution and Pretrain Dataset Filters 
- Accompanying Tables
- Model Family Pages
- Downstream Head Pages
- Models Added:
  - [ConvNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)
  - [TransNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17132)

## Updates
- 9-7-2024: added title bar; improved links and table gen
- 9-6-2024: added downstream head page
- 9-4-2024: added model family page
- 9-2-2024: added resolution and pretraining dataset filters
