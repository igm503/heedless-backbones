left in papers
- transnext
-- ade20k results; coco dino results
- convnext
-- ade20k results
- swin
-- ade20k results; coco HTC++ results
- deit iii
-- ade20k results; cifar, and a couple other classification results
- hiera
-- inaturalist finetune results and places365;
- internimage
-- internimage-h (trained on joint semi-labeled datasets; downstream is with dino and mask2former)
- focalnet
-- focalnet-h (no normal classificaiton or ds reults)
-- ade20k results; other ds head results
- CSwin
-- ade20k results
- MetaFormers
-- ade20k results
- VMamba
-- fps results for higher resolutions (not trained at higher res though)

leftover cross references
- efficientNetv2
-- deit iii paper has throughput on v100 amp, imagenetv2

- internimage
-- convnext-b fp16 a100 throughput(?)

- VMamba
-- swin, convnext, deit fps results a100 fp32 (I think)

-hiera
-- vit, mcmae a100 fp16 classificaiton speed 
-- mvit, vitdet v100 fp32 det speed

- MetaFormers
-- Swin and Convnext a100 TF32 throughput that differs from convnext report (is faster)

other notes
- CSwin
-- Need to confirm pub date and CMaskRNN FPS details
- hiera
-- flop count
- MetaFormers
-- They say they use macs, but there numbers suggest they are using flops. I assumed macs and multiplied by 2. Need to check.
-- Need to confirm precision of CascadeMaskRCNN FPS measurements.

code
- fix semantic seg resolution (need to decide bteween train and test res, to not confuse fps measurements)
- semantic seg put res in train snippets (graph and tables)
- semantic seg dataset and head page default plot options need to be set correctly
- comparison of same instance results and metrics doesn't show correct results when different heads are selected.
- add github link
- add about page
- too many links will take you to new tab
